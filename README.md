WIZARD
======

This is a nodejs implementation of the card game Wizard. This version is still pretty raw so join in to make it rock.

To install, you will need following versions of node / npm"

```
node - 0.8.28
npm  - 1.2.30

```

To run locally simply clone the repo and run:

`$ node app.js`

which by default starts up a server on port 8080 of your local machine.
